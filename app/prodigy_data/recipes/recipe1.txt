Text Classification -Manual recipe

Manually annotate categories that apply to a text. If only one label is set, the classification interface is used. 
If more than one label is specified, the choice interface is used and categories are added as multiple choice options.
If the --exclusive flag is set, categories become mutually exclusive, meaning that only one can be selected during annotation.
