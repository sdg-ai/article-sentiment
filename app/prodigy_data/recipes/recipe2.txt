Text Classification - textcat.teach (Active Learning)


Collect the best possible training data for a text named entity recognition model with the model in the loop. Based on your annotations, Prodigy will decide which questions to ask next. 
All annotations will be stored in the database. If a patterns file is supplied via the --patterns argument, the matches will be included in the stream and the matched spans are highlighted, 
so you’re able to tell which words or phrases the selection was based on. 
Note that the exact pattern matches have no influence when updating the model – they’re only used to help pre-select examples for annotation.
